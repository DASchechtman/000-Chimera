# Chimera Programming language

Chimera the programming language aims to help developers create and maintain software by allowing them to build the smallest parts of the program in software, and combining them
to form the full solution to whatever problem facing the developer. Please note that this language is still in development.

The main way Chimera aims to do this is to allow for as much of the program as possible to be a discrete part that can be built upon to make bigger and bigger parts. from something as simple as assignments "x = 1" to more complex structures and objects, functions, and programming paradigms
